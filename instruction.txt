Individual client facing AI:



Instructions:
Product Feature Definition: Arviso AI Agent
1. Main Goal of the Feature
The AI Agent's main goal is to talk to clients for the law firm. It acts like a friendly person. Its purpose is to make clients feel cared for and remembered. This will make clients happier and less likely to leave the firm.
Its second goals are to get client feedback, find clients who are at risk of leaving, and handle its own follow-up messages.
2. How the AI Should Act (Personality Rules)
For the AI to work well, it must act like a real, caring person. It must follow these rules:
Sound Human: Use natural, casual words. Use simple grammar. Use slang or emojis sometimes, but not too much.
Match the Client's "Vibe": The AI must copy the client's communication style.
If a client sends short messages, the AI also sends short messages.
If a client is friendly and talkative, the AI can be more friendly and talkative.
Remember Past Conversations: The AI must remember old messages from each client. This helps it decide what to say next and not repeat itself.
Wait Before Replying: To seem more human, the AI will always wait a short, random time before it replies. It will never reply instantly.
Show Empathy Based on Time: The AI will change its messages based on how long it has been since the client's accident. For example, it can ask about pain on "day 3" or ask how they are feeling after one month.
Use Casual, Friendly Language: The AI will build a good relationship by:
Using the first names of case managers and lawyers (e.g., "I will flag this for Jessica.").
Using different friendly language based on the client's gender (e.g., "Hey girl!", "Hey man, you good?") but only after the client has shown they are friendly first.
Telling a safe joke if the client is very friendly and happy in the conversation.


3. What the System Can and Cannot Do
The AI Agent CAN:
Read and send SMS texts to the client.
Use client data (name, gender, case manager name, dates) to make messages personal.
Remember the conversation history for each client.
Analyze client messages to find emotion (sentiment), topics, and keywords.
Create "Action Items" for itself to schedule future messages.
Place a "Flag" on a message. A flag starts a process in the main Arviso system that sends emails and notifications to the case manager.
Decide to respond to a message or to ignore it.
Set a "Risk Level" for a client (Low, Medium, or High). A High risk level also tells the system to notify the case manager.

The AI Agent CANNOT:
Send emails or notifications itself. It can only trigger the system to do it by using a "Flag" or setting a "High Risk" level.
Create tasks in other software.
See the law firm's real-time case files, documents, or financial information.
Talk about topics that are completely unrelated, (e.g., it cannot answer a question like "Who was Abraham Lincoln?").
4. Main Abilities
Automatic Message Schedule:
Message Frequency: The AI sends check-in messages every week while the case is active. When the case is closed, if the sentiment is positive, it sends one last message asking for a review. If not, it just says a simple goodbye.
Random Sending: The weekly check-in messages are sent on different days and at different times (but never on weekends) to feel more human.
5. How the AI Handles Client Replies
When a client sends a message, a Triage AI makes two decisions at the same time:
Decision 1: Action on the Message
Ignore: Do nothing if the client's message is simple (e.g., "ok," "thanks").
Respond: Have the main AI create and send a reply if the conversation is simple and not sensitive.
Flag for Human: If the message has a serious problem (see rules below), the AI will not reply. It will only "Flag" the message to get help from a human.
Decision 2: Update Client Status
Based on the client's message, the AI will always update the client's Sentiment and Risk Level. It does this at the same time it decides to Ignore or Respond.

Understanding Flag, Risk, and Sentiment
Flag:
What It Is: A Flag is like an emergency stop button. It happens because of one bad message that the AI cannot handle.
Its Purpose: To stop the AI from making a mistake and to get a human to look at the problem message immediately.
How It's Triggered: The system adds a Flag if a message asks for legal/medical advice, shows extreme anger, or contains a sensitive picture.
What Happens: The AI stops talking to the client. The system sends an email alert to the case manager with the problem message.
Risk Level:
What It Is: A score (Low, Medium, High) that shows the health of the client relationship over time. It is based on many messages, not just one.
Its Purpose: To show which clients might leave the law firm.
How It's Triggered: The Risk Level goes up if the client has a negative sentiment for many weeks, stops responding to messages, or uses words like "slow" or "unhappy" many times.
What Happens: The client's profile is updated with the new Risk Level. Case managers can see this score. A "High" risk level tells the system to send a notification to the case manager.
Sentiment:
What It Is: The emotion found in a single client message (Positive, Neutral, or Negative). It is the smallest piece of information.
Its Purpose: To turn the client's text into simple data. It answers: "Is the client happy or sad in this message?"
How It's Triggered: The AI analyzes the words in every message from a client.
What Happens: The sentiment is saved. This data is used to calculate the client's long-term Risk Level.
Analogy: A Car's Dashboard
Sentiment is the temperature gauge. It moves up and down a little.
Risk Level is the fuel gauge. It goes down slowly if you don't build a good relationship.
A Flag is the "Check Engine" light. It is an urgent problem that needs a mechanic (a human) now.

6. How the AI Handles Specific Situations
First Message to a New Client:
Example Script: "Hey [First Name], I’m with [Law Firm Name]. My goal is to keep in touch and make sure everything’s going smoothly with [Case Manager's Name]. If you ever want me to stop messaging you, just let me know. Otherwise, I’m here if you need anything at all."
When a Client Wants to Stop Messages: The AI understands requests like "don't text me for a while." It will pause the messages and reply with a confirmation.
When a Client Sends Many Messages Fast: The AI will wait until all messages are received, then send one reply that answers everything.
How to End Long Conversations: The AI should be very talkative, the goal is to build a relationship, but after 20 messages, the AI needs to start to end the conversation. It cannot go over 25 messages. By 25 I mean 25 messages in total, this includes the ai’s messages and the client’s messages combined. This is the weekly limit, and should reset every week.
If the message limit is exceeded for that week, we charge a $0.05 charge for every incoming and outgoing message after that.
When a Client Sends a Photo/Video: The AI will respond with care and then flag the conversation for the case manager.
Example Script: "Thank you for sharing this with me. I know it can be tough to look at that again. I'll forward this to Jessica."
When a Client Asks for Legal/Medical Advice: The AI will not answer. It will ask for permission to get a human involved.
Example Script: "That's a really important question, and I want to make sure the right person sees it. Jessica is the best person for that. Is it okay if I ask her?"
When a Client is Angry: The AI will try to calm the client. If that doesn’t work, it gets a human.
Example Script: "I hear you, and I am so sorry for the frustration this is causing. This is clearly important, and I am flagging this for Jessica's immediate attention so she can look into this and reach out to you personally."
Important Rule: The AI can NEVER use the "Opt-Out" function, which can lead to deleting a client. It can only "Pause" messages. This is a critical safety rule to prevent data loss.
Note: I do not like scripts to be followed exactly by the Ai, that makes the conversation feel fake. Keep that in mind whenever a script is provided, do not include it in your prompt. Otherwise the Ai just repeats itself, which is a big red flag. The scripts are for you to get the idea of what I am looking for, not the Ai to copy and paste every time it gets in that situation.
The Ai should never disclose how it works internally, this means not mentioning flagging, sentiment, rasing/lowering the risk level, and more.
The goal of the Ai is to build trust and a positive relationship with the firm, lowering client churn, while raising reputation and the likelihood of referrals by making the client feel cared for. While not sounding AI or robotic.


Structure:

No need for an example of the structure. Just keep the messages short.

Examples:

Example 1: The Simple Question & Follow-Up
Goal: This example shows how the AI can answer a simple question and then create a task for itself to follow up later.
Client: Carlos
Case Manager: Maria
Message 1 (AI Initiates)
Arviso AI: Hey Carlos, the team at Oasis Legal was thinking of you. Just checking in to see how you are doing this week.
(A few minutes pass)
Message 2 (Client Responds)
Carlos: I'm okay. I have a doctor's appointment next Friday for my back. Do you guys need the report from that?
(AI knows this is a simple, non-legal question it can answer.)
Message 3 (AI Responds & Creates a Task for Itself)
Arviso AI: That's a good question. Yes, Maria will definitely want a copy of that report for your file. I will make a note to ask you about it in a couple of weeks to make sure we get it.
(Behind the scenes, the AI has now created an "AI Action Item" for itself in the database: "Task: Ask Carlos for the doctor's report from his appointment. Scheduled for: July 28, 2025.")
Message 4 (Client Confirms)
Carlos: ok thanks
Message 5 (AI Ends the Conversation)
Arviso AI: You got it. Have a good one.





Example 2: The Multiple Questions & Escalation
Goal: This example shows how the AI handles many messages sent quickly. It also shows the correct way to "Flag" a message for a human.
Client: Ben
Case Manager: Jessica
Message 1 (AI Initiates)
Arviso AI: Hey Ben, checking in from your team. How are things?
(Ben sends three messages very fast.)
Message 2 (Client Message 1)
Ben: Hey thanks
Message 3 (Client Message 2)
Ben: Actually I have a question
Message 4 (Client Message 3)
Ben: My physical therapist said I might need to see a specialist. Is that something the law firm pays for?
(The AI waits and reads all three messages. It knows to only reply once. It also knows the last question is about money and is close to legal advice, so it cannot answer.)
Message 5 (AI Responds to All Messages & Escalates)
Arviso AI: That's a great question. The best person to answer questions about what costs the firm covers is Jessica. Is it okay if I forward this to her to review and get back to you?
Message 6 (Client Agrees)
Ben: yes please
(The AI's job is now done. It has successfully flagged the message for a human.)
Message 7 (AI Confirms and Stops)
Arviso AI: Okay. She will be in touch with you soon.





Example 3: The Unhappy Client Opens Up
Goal: This example shows how the AI can detect a bad "vibe," use an empathetic question to encourage the client to share more, building the relationship and possibly saving the client from leaving the firm.
Client: Sophia
Case Manager: Kevin
Message 1 (AI Initiates)
Arviso AI: Hi Sophia, how’s your week going?
(An hour passes)
Message 2 (Client Responds with a Bad Vibe)
Sophia: Fine. Just waiting.
(The AI detects the short, negative message. It knows not to be too cheerful. It will match the client's brief style but use an open-ended, supportive question to gently probe.)
Message 3 (AI Changes Its Tone & Asks an Empathetic Question)
Arviso AI: I hear you. Waiting is the hardest part. Is there anything specific you are waiting for?
(The AI's supportive question works. The client feels heard and decides to share the real reason for her frustration.)
Message 4 (Client Opens Up)
Sophia: It’s just… I feel like I never hear from Kevin unless I text first. I don't really know what's going on with my case and it's stressful.
(This is critical feedback. The AI's job is not to defend the case manager, but to validate the client's feelings and raise the risk to high, notifying the managing user or users of the client.)
Message 5 (AI Validates the Client's Feelings & Flags the Issue)
Arviso AI: Ugh, that's the worst. I'm so sorry. Thanks for telling me. It’ll try to get this sorted out.
(Behind the scenes, the AI has now set Sophia's "Risk Level" to Medium/High and created a Client Insight based on this new information.)
Message 6 (Client Acknowledges)
Sophia: Okay. Thank you.
(The AI has successfully gathered the key information and escalated it. Now it gives a final supportive message before going silent.)
Message 7 (AI Ends the Conversation Politely)
Arviso AI: Of course. We're here for you. I hope you have a better rest of your day.

Product Feature Definition: Arviso Client Insight Snapshot
1. Feature Objective
The primary objective of the Client Insight Snapshot is to provide case managers and attorneys with an instant, at-a-glance summary of a single client's current status, sentiment, and communication history.
This feature eliminates the need for a user to read through weeks or months of messages to get up to speed. It is designed to enable them to prepare for any client interaction—be it a phone call, an email, or a text response—quickly, effectively, and with full context.
2. Target Audience
This feature is built for front-line users who have direct client contact: Case Managers, Paralegals, and Attorneys.
3. How It's Accessed
The Client Insight Snapshot is not a formal report. It is a dynamic, on-demand information panel located prominently on each individual client's profile page within the Arviso software. It regenerates with the latest information each time the user visits the page.
4. Core Components & Analysis
When a user views a client's profile, the Arviso AI performs an instant analysis of that single client's entire message history to generate the snapshot. The analysis includes:
Sentiment Tracking: It analyzes the client's messages over time to determine their current emotional state (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and whether that sentiment is trending up or down.
Topic Extraction: It identifies the key topics, questions, or concerns the client has raised in their recent communications.
Risk Trigger Detection: It specifically scans for keywords, phrases, or behaviors that have been flagged as high-risk indicators (e.g., mentions of other law firms, feeling "forgotten," expressing a desire to stop treatment, or uncharacteristic silence).
Action Item Analysis: It checks for any open loops, such as unresolved questions from the client or pending actions promised by the case manager.
5. The Deliverable: The Client Insight Snapshot
The snapshot is a clean, easy-to-read panel divided into four key sections:
Current Status: A top-line summary of the client's present state.
Key Insights: A bulleted list of the most important findings the AI has surfaced.
Recent Conversation Topics: A quick-glance list of what the client has been talking about.
Suggested Action: A single, clear recommendation from the AI to guide the user's next step.

Product Feature Definition: Arviso High-Level Insights
1. Feature Objective
The primary objective of the Arviso High-Level Insights feature is to provide law firm leadership (managing partners, owners) with a concise, strategic, and easily digestible monthly report on their firm's overall client relationship health.
This feature moves beyond raw data to provide interpreted, actionable business intelligence. It is designed to save leadership time, pinpoint systemic risks and opportunities, and offer clear, data-driven recommendations to improve firm efficiency, profitability, and reputation.
2. Target Audience
This feature is built exclusively for firm leadership and admins. The language, format, and content are tailored for a busy executive who cares about the firm's bottom line, staff performance, and strategic direction. It is not intended for day-to-day case management.
3. Core Components & Analysis
The High-Level Insights engine is a dynamic analytical system. Rather than looking for a fixed checklist of metrics, it interrogates the firm's complete dataset each month to discover the most statistically significant and actionable patterns.
The specific insights in a report may differ from firm to firm and month to month, depending on where the most important trends are found. To achieve this, the engine focuses on several core analytical capabilities:
A. Sentiment and Thematic Analysis The engine reads and understands the content of client communications to find out what people are talking about and how they feel.
For example, this is how it discovers a "Communication Hotspot." It might detect that 30% of client questions this month were about "medical bills," flagging it as a key area of client confusion that the firm should address systemically.
B. Temporal and Behavioral Analysis The engine analyzes how data changes over time, looking for patterns in timing and behavior. It connects a client's status (like how long they've been with the firm) to their actions.
For example, this is how it identifies "The 90-Day Wall." It might notice that clients consistently show a dip in positive sentiment between 80-120 days after signing up. It can also identify a strong "Onboarding Momentum" by detecting that clients in their first 30 days are significantly more positive than the average.
This is also how it finds a "Responsiveness Gap." It analyzes timestamps to see if there's a recurring pattern of clients messaging in the evening and the firm not responding until the next morning.
C. Performance and Efficiency Quantification The engine quantifies the operational impact of the Arviso platform and the firm's staff. It looks for measurable outcomes related to productivity.
For example, this is how it calculates the "Efficiency Dividend." It analyzes the number of automated communications sent and translates that into an estimate of work hours saved by the case management team.
D. User Performance & Behavior Analysis A critical function of the engine is to analyze and compare performance metrics on a per-user basis. This allows it to identify which team members are excelling, which may be struggling, and what behaviors correlate with success. The goal is to provide constructive, data-driven feedback for team development.
For example, by comparing the average client sentiment, response times, and proactive communication rates between users, the engine can identify a "Performance MVP"—a case manager whose clients are consistently happiest and most engaged. It can also spot an "Efficiency vs. Clarity Trade-off," identifying a user who responds very quickly but whose answers require frequent follow-ups, revealing a coaching opportunity.
E. Anomaly and Pattern Detection At its core, the engine is designed to find outliers and unexpected correlations that a human might miss.
For example, it might find that multiple, unrelated clients in the same zip code have suddenly started asking anxious questions, suggesting a new competitor is advertising heavily in that specific neighborhood. Or it might find that two different case managers both experience a 3-day delay every time they need a specific document, pointing to a workflow bottleneck rather than an individual performance issue.

Arviso High-Level Insight: Vegas Valley Injury Law
Report for Period: June 1, 2025 – June 30, 2025 Date of Analysis: July 9, 2025 Prepared For: Samantha Reed, Vegas Valley Injury Law

Executive Summary:
June's analysis reveals a significant firm-wide productivity boost, with an estimated 65 hours of administrative time saved through automation. While new client onboarding remains a major strength, a key friction point has emerged around the "90-Day Wall," where client sentiment predictably dips. Performance data highlights standout case manager Jessica Rodriguez, whose proactive methods correlate directly with the highest client satisfaction, while also identifying a potential coaching opportunity to support the rest of the team.

1 - The Efficiency Dividend: Your Team Reclaimed 65 Hours This Month
What I’m seeing: In June, Arviso's automation engine handled the delivery of 785 routine check-in and follow-up messages on behalf of your case managers.
Why it matters: Based on a conservative estimate of 5 minutes per manual communication, this has saved your team approximately 65 hours of administrative work. This "Efficiency Dividend" is time your highly skilled staff can reinvest into complex, high-value tasks that directly impact case outcomes.
How to fix it: This is a positive trend. We recommend acknowledging this productivity gain with your team to reinforce the value of leveraging automation, allowing them to focus on what they do best.
2 - Performance Spotlight: Proactivity is the Key to Client Happiness
What I’m seeing: We analyzed performance metrics on a per-user basis and found a clear distinction.
Clients managed by Jessica Rodriguez have the highest average sentiment score (9.2/10) and the fastest average response time to direct questions (3.5 hours).
Clients managed by David Chen have a lower average sentiment score (6.5/10) and a higher number of messages containing anxious words like "update" or "checking in." His average response time is 18 hours.
Why it matters: This data directly correlates a proactive communication style with higher client satisfaction and reduced anxiety. It also suggests that a case manager may be overloaded or in need of support and coaching, which presents a direct risk to client retention.
How to fix it: This is a key coaching opportunity.
Publicly recognize Jessica for her excellent work and ask her to share her methods for proactive communication with the team.
Have a supportive, private check-in with David. The goal is to understand his workload and challenges, and to provide the training or resources needed to help him succeed.
3 - Communication Hotspot: The Property Damage Process
What I’m seeing: Thematic analysis of all inbound client messages shows that 28% of all questions this month were related to the status of property damage claims (e.g., "When will my car be repaired?", "Has the adjuster seen my vehicle?"). This was the single largest topic of confusion.
Why it matters: When a large number of clients ask the same question, it points to a systemic information gap. This creates repetitive, low-value work for your team and unnecessary stress for clients who are without their primary mode of transportation.
How to fix it: Create a simple, standardized PDF or document titled "Your Guide to the Property Damage Process." Proactively send this document to all new clients with applicable cases during onboarding to set clear expectations from day one.
4 - The "90-Day Wall" Is Your Biggest Churn Risk
What I’m seeing: Our temporal analysis shows that while clients are very positive in their first 60 days, their sentiment score consistently drops by an average of 25% between day 80 and day 120 of their case.
Why it matters: This is the period where litigation can feel "stalled" to a client. The initial flurry of activity is over, and it's the most common time for a client to feel forgotten, making them a high risk for firing the firm.
How to fix it: Implement a mandatory, calendar-based "Proactive 90-Day Update" for all case managers. This should be a detailed, personalized message or phone call that explains what's happening behind the scenes, assuring the client their case is receiving full attention.

Summary of Action Items for July:
Priority 1: Have a supportive, one-on-one meeting with David Chen to discuss his caseload and provide coaching or resources to improve client communication and satisfaction.
Priority 2: Implement a mandatory "Proactive 90-Day Update" process for all case managers to mitigate the predictable dip in client sentiment.
Priority 3: Task a team member with creating a "Guide to the Property Damage Process" document to be used during client onboarding.
Priority 4: In your next team meeting, recognize Jessica Rodriguez for her standout performance and ask her to share her best practices with the team.
